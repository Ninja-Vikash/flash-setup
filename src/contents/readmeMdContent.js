export const readmeMdContent = `# flash-setup

A quick project setup built with \`flash-setup\`.

### Agenda
Why do we need to install packages after creating a Vite project for a React app?

Here is a quick solution to get rid of this.<br/>
**flash-setup**, an executable CLI to streamline the process of necessary package installation.

âœ… Vite++ (extended Vite) <br/>
âœ… Support for CSS frameworks like TailwindCSS | Material UI <br/>
âœ… Support for import alias

\`\`\`bash
# Setting up the project via CLI ðŸ‘‡
npx flash-setup
\`\`\`

Build your dream projects faster with flash-setup.

**Happy Coding ðŸ’–!**`;
